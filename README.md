# Linear-Algebra-with-Julia
This repository is created to learn and demonstrate Julia way of doing Linear Algebra


We will be taking Prof. Gilbert Strang's linear algebra course 'MIT A 2020 Vision of Linear Algebra, Spring 2020'

In this vison series, each lecture talks about one area of linear algebra. We will implement the same in Julia notebook

 - Part 1: The Column Space of a Matrix
